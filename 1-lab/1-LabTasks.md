# 2nd Lab in Computer Networks

This lab has the goal to program an application that exchanges data over UDP datagrams. For this one end will take the role of the client and the other the role of the server. 

## Preparation before getting to you Lap Appointment

Please re-use the settings from the 1st lab (0-lab) for this lab setup, i.e., same containerlab file etc. 

### The Programing Language and Environment
Pick one programming language of your choice, but check:
- if there is a socket application programming interface (API) available
- that this API offers the functions shown and discussed in the lecture, e.g., ````socket()````, ````read()````
- that you either compile this program outside the docker containers, e.g., on a linux system such as the virtual machine
- and that anything that is required to compile the program is actual setup correctly.

In case you need help or have questions, please feel free to ask. A tip: typically each programming language has installations procedures documented on their web page or in their documentation. For instance, for the *go* language you can find it [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).

Further, in order to improve this lab task for further students, you may propose good links to documentation for installing programing languages (or their tools)

For your development environment: Use the one you are used to or select one. 

You can use a relative simple environment and upload the compiled code via scp into the docker containers in the containerlab.
