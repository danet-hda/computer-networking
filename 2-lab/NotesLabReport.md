# Notes on how to write a scientific Lab Report

You will have to submit written reports for some of the computer network labs. Please submit them as PDF. 

The lab report must document the tasks during the work at the lab, answer the posed questions or tasks, document your findings, any open question or any unresolved issue. Any used literature, e.g., out of the preparation of the lab, must be cited as reference. 

Please note that the description here states what is needed for a simplified scientifc report. 

## Structure of such report

Such a report can follow this structure:
- Introduction
- Related Work to know
- Measurement Setup
- Measurement Results
- Discussion

## Language

You can write the report either in German or English, as you prefer. 

In any case, please take care of proper writing :-) 

## Use of Figures and Text

You can use figures and text to discribe the lab setup and your findings. If you are using figures, please "use" them in the text, by referencing them and a (short) explanation or discussion in the text.

For instance, if you have a network flow diagram you can give it a label, e.g., "Figure 1: ARP flow diagram" and say in your text "Figure 1 shows the network flow for ARP between host01 and router01.". 

## How to use references

You will for sure use other sources than your own knowledge, e.g., reading about the NDP. Note the used source, e.g., textbook, scientific paper, standards document, down. When you write text in your report that relies on the knowledge of your source, you mark this text accordingly as being out of your source, i.e., you cite it. Typically this can be done in your case with adding a reference to the paragraph where you used information from the source:

*This paragraph describes how the NDP works[1]* 

Whereas [1] links to the reference list's entry for the reference NDP in this case. 

The entry for [1] could read like this: NARTEN, Thomas, et al. RFC 4861: Neighbor discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6). 2007.
