# Notes on how to write a scientific Lab Report

You will have to submit written reports for some the computer network labs. Please submit them as PDF. 

The lab report must document the tasks during the work at the lab, answer the posed questions or tasks, document your findings, any open question or any unresolved issue. Any used literature, e.g., out of the preparation of the lab, must be cited as reference. 

## How to use references

You will for sure use other sources than your own knowledge, e.g., reading about the NDP. Note the used source, e.g., textbook, scientific paper, standards document, down. When you write text in your report that relies on the knowledge of your source, you mark this text accordingly as being out of your source, i.e., you cite it. Typically this can be done in your case with adding a reference to the paragraph where you used information from the source:

*This paragraph describes how the NDP works[1]* 

Whereas [1] links to the reference list's entry for the reference NDP in this case. 

The entry for [1] could read like this: NARTEN, Thomas, et al. RFC 4861: Neighbor discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6). 2007.
