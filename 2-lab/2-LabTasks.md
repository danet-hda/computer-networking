# 3rd Lab in Computer Networks: Mapping IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses to Link Layer Addresses

This lab has the goal to learn about the mechanisms and protocols that are used to map Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to link Layer addresses. For IP there are two different version in use by today:
- Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4)
- Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)

Both use a different protocol above the link layer address for
- IPv4 is the Adress Resolution Protocol (ARP)
- IPv6 is the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)

## Preparation before getting to your Lab Appointment

Please re-use the settings from the 1st lab (0-lab) for this lab setup, i.e., same containerlab file und also the same IP address configuration *host00* and *router00*.
