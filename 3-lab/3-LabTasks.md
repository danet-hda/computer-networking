# 4th Lab in Computer Networks: IP Subnetworks and basic Routing 

This lab has the goal to learn about:
- calculating IP subnetworks
- assigning IP addresses to interfaces
- configuring the routing
- testing of the routing configuration


## Preparation before getting to your Lab Appointment

Please re-use the settings from the 1st lab (0-lab) for this lab setup, i.e., same containerlab file. 

### IP addresses for the 2 Subnetworks
Use one of the private IP addresses ranges for the tasks here:
- Calculate two IP subnetworks that can hold only 2 IP addresses but no further IP addresses to be assigned to interfaces;
- Document your calculation and any further information you do need for configuring the subnetworks;

### How to configure IP-Routes in Linux

Routes on Linux are configured with the ```route``` command. Please read in appropriate sources how the route command works. 

You will need to know how to add, remove, and show routes. 

## Tasks for the Lab Appointment

Configure the IP addresses and routes on all involved interfaces and hosts/router. 

Ensure that everything is properly configured by running a ping from the IP address of host00 to host 01. If it works, please talk with the lab supervisor.

If it doesn't work, please talk with the lab supervisor, but consider how you could debug the problem. 


## Lab Report to be written

There is no report to submit, but document your work for your reference.

## Good to Know

Read before the lab appointment about how to configure routes in Linux and see again how to configure IP addresses.
